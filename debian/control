Description: create and work with Matroska media files
 Matroska is aiming to become the standard of Multimedia Container
 Formats. It is based on EBML (Extensible Binary Meta Language), a
 kind of binary version of XML. These tools can work with Matroska files:
   * mkvmerge creates Matroska files from various other formats.
   * mkvinfo lists information about the tracks contained in a Matroska
     file.
   * mkvextract extracts tracks from a Matroska file into other suitable
     file formats.
   * base64tool can encode to and decode from base64.
