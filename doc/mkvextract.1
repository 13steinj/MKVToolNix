.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program extracts specific parts from a Matroska file to other useful
formats. The first argument tells \fBmkvextract\fR what to extract. Currently
supported is the extraction of \fBtracks\fR, \fBtags\fR, \fBattachments\fR,
\fBchapters\fR and \fBCUE sheets\fR.
The second argument is the name of the source file. It must be a Matroska file.

.LP
Command line syntax for the \fBtracks\fR extraction mode:
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIcharset\fR
Sets the charset to convert the next text subtitle track to. Only valid if the
next track ID targets a text subtitle track. It defaults to UTF-8.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-ogg\fR
Only valid for FLAC tracks. Normally FLAC tracks are embedded in an Ogg
transport stream. With this switch they are extracted to raw FLAC files
instead.
.TP
\fB\-\-cuesheet\fR
Causes \fBmkvextract\fR to extract a CUE sheet from the chapter information
and tag data for the following track into a file whose name is the track's
output name with ".cue" appended to it.
.TP
\fB\-\-blockadd\fR \fIlevel\fR
Keep only the BlockAdditions up to this level.
The default is to keep all levels.
This option only affects certain kinds of codecs like WAVPACK4.
.TP
\fITID\fR:\fIoutname\fR
Causes extraction of the track with the ID \fITID\fR into the file
\fIoutname\fR if such a track exists in the source file. This option can be
given multiple times. The track IDs are the same as the ones output by
\fBmkvmerge\fR's \fB--identify\fR option.
.br
Each output name should be used only once. The exception are RealAudio and
RealVideo tracks. If you use the same name for different tracks then those
tracks will be saved in the same file. Example:
.br
\fBmkvextract tracks input.mkv 1:output-two-tracks.rm 2:output-two-tracks.rm\fR
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose and show all the important Matroska elements as they're read.

.LP
Command line syntax for the \fBtags\fR extraction mode:
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose and show all the important Matroska elements as they're read.

.LP
Command line syntax for the \fBattachments\fR extraction mode:
.TP
\fIAID\fR:\fIoutname\fR
Causes extraction of the attachment with the ID \fIAID\fR into the file
\fIoutname\fR if such an attachment exists in the source file. This option can
be given multiple times. The attachment IDs are the same as the ones output by
\fBmkvmerge\fR's \fB--identify\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose and show all the important Matroska elements as they're read.

.LP
Command line syntax for the \fBchapters\fR extraction mode:
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-simple\fR
Exports the chapter information in the simple format used in the OGM tools
(CHAPTER01=..., CHAPTER01NAME=...). In this mode some information has to be
discarded. Default is to output the chapters in XML format.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose and show all the important Matroska elements as they're read.

.LP
Command line syntax for the \fBcuesheet\fR extraction mode:
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose and show all the important Matroska elements as they're read.

.LP
If one of the following options is used as the only command line argument
additional information about \fBmkvextract\fR is output.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show usage information.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Show version information.


.SH NOTES
The decision about the output format is based on the track type, not on the
extension used for the output file name. The following track types are
supported at the moment:
.TP
V_MS/VFW/FOURCC
Fixed FPS video tracks with this CodecID are written to AVI files.
.TP
V_REAL/*
RealVideo tracks are written to RealMedia files.
.TP
A_MPEG/L3, A_AC3
These will be extracted to raw MP3 and AC3 files.
.TP
A_PCM/INT/LIT
Raw PCM data will be written to a WAV file.
.TP
A_AAC/MPEG2/*
All MPEG2 AAC files will be written into an AAC file with ADTS headers before
each packet.
.TP
A_AAC/MPEG4/*
All MPEG4 AAC files will be written into an AAC file with ADTS headers before
each packet. The ADTS headers will not contain the deprecated emphasis field.
.TP
A_VORBIS
Vorbis audio will be written into an Ogg/Vorbis file.
.TP
A_REAL/*
RealAudio tracks are written to RealMedia files.
.TP
A_TTA1
TrueAudio tracks are written to TTA files. Please note that due to Matroska's
limited timecode precision the extracted file's header will be different
regarding two fields: data_length (the total number of samples in the file)
and the CRC.
.TP
S_TEXT/UTF8
Simple text subtitles will be written as SRT files.
.TP
S_TEXT/SSA, S_TEXT/ASS
SSA and ASS text subtitles will be written as SSA/ASS files respectively.
.LP
\fBTags\fR are converted to a XML format. This format is the same that
\fBmkvmerge\fR supports for reading tags.
.LP
\fBAttachments\fR are written to they output file as they are. No conversion
whatsoever is done.
.LP
\fBChapters\fR are converted to a XML format. This format is the same that
\fBmkvmerge\fR supports for reading chapters. Alternatively a stripped-down
version can be output in the simple OGM style format.


.SH EXAMPLES
Let's assume you've made a Matroska file with one video track, two audio tracks
and two subtitle tracks, and you need the second audio track and the first
subtitle track. So first fire up \fBmkvmerge\fR with the \fB--identify\fR
option:
.LP
$ \fBmkvmerge -i movie.mkv\fR
.br
File 'movie.mkv': container: Matroska
.br
Track ID 1: video (V_MS/VFW/FOURCC, DIV3)
.br
Track ID 2: audio (A_MPEG/L3)
.br
Track ID 3: audio (A_VORBIS)
.br
Track ID 4: subtitles (S_TEXT/UTF8)
.br
Track ID 5: subtitles (S_TEXT/UTF8)
.LP
Now you can call \fBmkvextract\fR like this:
.LP
$ \fBmkvextract tracks movie.mkv 3:audio.ogg 4:subtitles.srt\fR
.LP
Another example. Let's assume you have a Matroska file with one RealVideo v10
track, one Vorbis audio track and one RealAudio (COOK) track. The
identification output might look like this:
.LP
$ \fB mkvmerge -i movie2.mkv\fR
.br
File 'movie2.mkv': container: Matroska
.br
Track ID 1: video (V_REAL/RV40)
.br
Track ID 2: audio (A_VORBIS)
.br
Track ID 3: audio (A_REAL/COOK)
.LP
Let's further assume you want only need the video and the RealAudio track but
both in the same output file. This is possible for RealMedia files by using
the same output name for those tracks that you want to end up in the same
file:
.LP
$ \fBmkvextract tracks movie2.mkv 1:extracted.rm 3:extracted.rm\fR
