.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program extracts selected tracks from a single Matroska file to other
suitable file formats.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR \fIinname\fR
Use '\fIinname\fR' as the source.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fIcharset\fR
Sets the charset to convert the next text subtitle track to. Only valid if the
next track ID targets a text subtitle track.
.TP
\fITID\fR:\fIoutname\fR
Causes extraction of the track with the ID \fITID\fR into the file
\fIoutname\fR if such a track exists in the source file. This option can be
given mutliple times. The track IDs are the same as the ones output by
\fBmkvmerge\fR's \fB--identify\fR option.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose and show all the important Matroska elements as they're read.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show usage information.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Show version information.

.SH NOTES
The decision about the output format is based on the track type, not on the
extension used for the output file name. The following track types are
supported at the moment:
.TP
V_MS/VFW/FOURCC
Fixed FPS video tracks with this CodecID are written to AVI files.
.TP
A_MPEG/L3, A_AC3
These will be extracted to raw MP3 and AC3 files.
.TP
A_PCM/INT/LIT
Raw PCM data will be written to a WAV file.
.TP
A_AAC/MPEG2/*
All MPEG2 AAC files will be written into an AAC file with ADTS headers before
each packet.
.TP
A_AAC/MPEG4/*
All MPEG4 AAC files will be written into an AAC file with ADTS headers before
each packet. The ADTS headers will not contain the deprecated emphasis field.
.TP
A_VORBIS
Vorbis audio will be written into an Ogg/Vorbis file.
.TP
S_TEXT/UTF8
Simple text subtitles will be written as SRT files.
.TP
S_TEXT/SSA, S_TEXT/ASS
SSA and ASS text subtitles will be written as SSA/ASS files respectively.

.SH EXAMPLES
Let's assume you've made a Matroska file with one video track, two audio tracks
and two subtitle tracks, and you need the second audio track and the first
subtitle track. So first fire up \fBmkvmerge\fR with the \fB--identify\fR
option:
.LP
$ \fBmkvmerge -i movie.mkv\fR
.br
File 'movie.mkv': container: Matroska
.br
Track ID 1: video (V_MS/VFW/FOURCC, DIV3)
.br
Track ID 2: audio (A_MPEG/L3)
.br
Track ID 3: audio (A_VORBIS)
.br
Track ID 4: subtitles (S_TEXT/UTF8)
.br
Track ID 5: subtitles (S_TEXT/UTF8)
.LP
Now you can call \fBmkvmextract\fR like this:
.LP
$ \fBmkvextract -i movie.mkv 3:audio.ogg 4:subtitles.srt\fR
