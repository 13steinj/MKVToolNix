  <h3><a name="whatismatroska">1.1. What is Matroska?</a></h3>

  <p>(<i>Note: simply copied from <a href="http://www.matroska.org/">
     www.matroska.org</a>.</i>)</p>

  <p><b>Matroska</b> aims to become THE Standard of Multimedia Container
   Formats. It was derived from a project called MCF, but
   differentiates from it significantly because it is based on EBML
   (Extensible Binary Meta Language), a binary derivative of XML. EBML
   enables the Matroska Development Team to gain significant advantages
   in terms of future format extensibility, without breaking file
   support in old parsers.</p>

  <p>If you need any more info please head over to
   <a href="http://www.matroska.org/">Matroska's homepage</a>.</p>

  <h3><a name="whatismkvmerge">1.2. What is mkvmerge? What is mkvmerge
    GUI?</a></h3>

  <p><i>mkvmerge</i> and <i>mkvmerge GUI</i> (or just <i>mmg</i>) are two
   programs created by <a href="mailto:moritz@bunkus.org">Moritz
   Bunkus</a>. They're part of the <i>mkvtoolnix</i> package. <i>mkvmerge</i>
   can read a lot of different multimedia files and put their contents into
   Matroska files. Unfortunately this is a command line program, and not
   everyone is comfortable working on the command line. This is where
   <i>mkvmerge GUI</i> comes into play. It is a GUI that provides the user
   with an intuitive but powerful interface to <i>mkvmerge</i>.</p>

    <p>Both programs are available for both Windows and GNU/Linux and
     other Unix derivatives. The program is licensed under the GPL, so
     the source code is available to anyone interested.</p>

    <h3><a name="latestversion">1.3. Obtaining the latest version</a></h3>

    <p>You can always find the latest version of <i>mkvtoolnix</i> on
     <a href="http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/">Moritz
      Bunkus' website</a>. Windows users will have to download the runtime
     DLLs as well as the <i>mkvtoolnix</i> binaries. Linux/Unix users
     will probably download the sources and compile
     <i>mkvtoolnix</i> themselves.</p>

    <h3><a name="scope">1.4. Scope of this guide</a></h3>

    <p>This guide only focuses on the GUI part of these tools. All
     command line options are explained in detail in <a
      href="mkvmerge.html"><i>mkvmerge</i>'s man page/HTML page</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="setup">2. Setting up mkvmerge GUI</a></h2>

  <p>(<i>Note: This section does not cover compilation and
    installation. <i>mkvmerge</i>'s own documentation and the
    <code>README</code> files that are included in the
    <i>mkvtoolnix</i> package.</i>)</p>

  <table width="100%" border="0">
   <tr>
    <td valign="top">
     <p>The only thing that <i>mmg</i> needs to know is the location
      of the <i>mkvmerge</i> binary. Under normal circumstances it
      will be found automatically. But if not then you can select
      the binary to use on the <i>Settings</i> tab.</p>

  <h2><a name="muxing">3. Creating Matroska files</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="basics">3.1. Basics</a></h3>

  <p><i>mkvmerge</i> strictly differentiates between <i>files</i> and
   <i>tracks</i>. An input <i>file</i> usually contains one or more
   <i>tracks</i>. <i>mkvmerge</i> needs at least one input file and the file
   name of the Matroska file it should create before it can do any
   work. Starting with this minimal set of options the user can add more input
   files, select advanced options for each track, apply some more global
   options etc.</p>

  <p>The typical basic steps are:<br>
   <ol>
    <li>Select some input <i>files</i>,</li>
    <li>set language options for the <i>tracks</i>,</li>
    <li>set the movie/file title,</li>
    <li>select the file to write to and</li>
    <li>start the muxing process.</li>
   </ol>
  </p>

  <table width="100%" border="0">
   <tr>
    <td valign="top">

     <p>When <i>mmg</i> starts up it shows the first and probably most
      important tab: the <i>input tab</i>. Here you see four different
      elements. The topmost input box lists all input
      <i>files</i>. Directly under this box are options that apply
      to the currently selected input <i>file</i>.</p>

     <p>The two buttons to the right of the upper list box can be used to add
      files to the list box with the <i>add</i> button and to remove the
      selected entry with the <i>remove</i> button.</p>

    </td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td valign="top">
     <img src="images/addremovefiles.png"
          alt="adding and removing files">
     <br>
     <font size="-1">Use these buttons to add and remove
      files.</font>
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td valign="top">
     <p>Once the user has added at least one input <i>file</i> in the upper
      list box the second list box will contains all available
      <i>tracks</i>. Each track is ENabled by default and will be
      muxed into the resulting file. However, you can change that by
      simply clicking on the check box right in front of the track's
      name in the second list box. For each of these tracks the user
      can select track specific options with the input boxes and
      check boxes below the track listing. These options will be
      described in the following sections.</p>

     <p>To the right of the track list box there are two buttons with which
      you can control the order of the tracks in the output file. By hitting
      the <i>up</i> and <i>down</i> the currently selected track is moved in
      the appropriate direction.</p>
    </td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td valign="top">

     <font size="-1">One enabled and one disabled track. The second track will
      not be copied into the output file.</font>
    </td>

   </tr>
  </table>


  <h3><a name="fileoptions">3.2. Options for input file</a></h3>

  <p>Once the user has added and selected an input file he can set options
   that apply to this specific file. At the moment three such options have
   been implemented, and they all are only available for Matroska files:
   <code>No chapters</code>, <code>No attachments</code> and <code>No
    tags</code>. These options tell <i>mkvmerge</i> not to copy any
   chapters / attachments / tags from the current source file.
   <br>
   <b>Note:</b> At the time of writing <i>mkvmerge</i> cannot copy tags from a
   source Matroska file. You have to extract them with mkvextract first.</p>

  <p>More information about chapters can be found in the section about the
   <a href="mkvmerge-gui.html#chaptereditor">chapter editor</a> in this
   document and in <i>mkvmerge</i>'s own documentation.</p>

  <h3><a name="trackoptions">3.3. Options for each track</a></h3>

  <p>Depending on the type of the currently selected track (audio, video,
   subtitles) and even depending on the contents of the track only a subset of
   all the track specific options are available. The options are:</p>

  <table width="100%" border="0">
   <tr>
    <td valign="top">
     <ul>

      <li><code>Language:</code> The user can select the language for each
       track regardless of its type. This language is coded in the ISO639-2
       language code. The drop-down box contains all ISO639-2 codes so the
       user does not have to worry about selecting the wrong language
       code.</li>

      <li><code>Track name:</code> The user can set a name for the current
       track. This name is a free-form string. Practical examples could be
       'director's comments' or 'great view of Seattle'. Note that these names
       are not meant to contain the movie title!</li>

      <li><code>Cues:</code> The <i>cues</i> are for Matroska what the index
       is for AVI files. They contain links to the key frames. Usually this
       option should be left on the value 'default'. <i>mkvmerge</i> will
       automatically chose the best method for any given track type. A full
       explanation of tracks can be found in <a
       href="mkvmerge.html"><i>mkvmerge</i>'s documentation</a>.</li>

      <li><code>Aspect ratio:</code> With this option the user can set the
       aspect ratio that should be used upon playback. It defaults to the
       aspect ratio that the movie was encoded with but can be changed,
       e.g. for anamorphic encodings. The GUI expects the format to be either
       a floating point number (e.g. '2.33') or a fraction (e.g. '16/9').
       <br>
       This option is only available for video tracks.</li>

      <li><code>FourCC:</code> Matroska does not normally store the Four-CC
       which is used in other containers to identify the codec used. Matroska
       has its own format, called <i>CodecID</i>, but it also has an AVI
       compatibility mode. In this mode the FourCC is also stored. With this
       option the FourCC can be forced to a different value. However, you
       cannot change the <i>CodecID</i> used by <i>mkvmerge</i>.
       <br>
       This option is only available for video tracks.</li>

      <li><code>Delay (in ms):</code> In some cases audio and video are not
       synchronized properly. With this option the user can offset the audio
       track by a given amount, either positive or negative. <i>mkvmerge</i>
       will either remove samples at the beginning or insert silence at the
       beginning to adjust the track.
       <br>
       This option is available for audio and text subtitle tracks.</li>

      <li><code>Stretch by:</code> In some cases audio and video slowly drift
       apart during playback. This can be fixed by supplying a factor of how
       much the time codes should be stretched by <i>mkvmerge</i>. If nothing
       is given then '1.0' is assumed which does not alter the time
       codes. Please note that this option has not been implemented for all
       audio track types yet.
       <br>
       This option is available for audio and text subtitle tracks.</li>

      <li><code>Subtitle charset:</code> Some text subtitle formats do not
       store the charset that they were created with. This is important
       because text subtitles are automatically converted to the UTF-8 charset
       during muxing. <i>mkvmerge</i> will normally assume that the system's
       current charset is the same that the subtitle file was written in. But
       in case this is not true the user can select the correct charset.
       <br>
       This option is only available for text subtitle tracks.</li>

      <li><code>Make default track:</code> Matroska knows a flag which tells
       the player that a specific track should be preferred upon playback if
       the user does not chose another one. Of course each track <i>type</i>
       has its own default track - e.g. the default audio track is the English
       one, and the default subtitle track is the French one. If no track is
       set to be the default track then <i>mkvmerge</i> will promote the first
       track of each type that it finds to be the default track. This is
       consistent with the behavior of various media players.</li>

      <li><code>AAC is SBR/HE-AAC/AAC+:</code> The new technology called 'high
       efficiency AAC' has some drawbacks when it is being stored in
       <code>.AAC</code> files: it is not possible to detect the HE-AAC part
       for these files. Therefore the user has to check this option manually
       if it applies. Please note that this problem does not exist for HE-AAC
       stored in <code>.MP4</code> files.</li>

      <li><code>Tags:</code> For each track you can create a XML tags
       file. For a full explanation of all tags please refer to the example
       file and <a href="mkvmerge.html"><i>mkvmerge</i>'s own
       documentation</a>. In probably 99% of all cases you want to use THIS
       option and associate tags with a specific track. The tags option on the
       global tab is probably not what you need.</li>

  <h3><a name="attachments">3.4. Attachments</a></h3>

  <table width="100%" border="0">
   <tr>
    <td valign="top">

     <p>Matroska files can also contain other files, called attachments. This
      works basically just like with your favorite email program. The idea is
      to provide additional information about the file. Some examples could be
      cover photos for a CD rip, additional background information in text
      form about the movie or even some compressed fonts for the
      subtitles.</p>

     <p>Every attachment needs two things: the file name (obviously) and the
      MIME type that should be associated with the file. The usage is very
      easy and similar to adding files on the
      <i>input</i> tab.</p>

     <p>On the second tab of the GUI, the <i>attachment</i> tab, you can add a
      file with the <i>+</i> button and remove the selected attachment with
      the <i>-</i> button. Once an attachment has been selected the other
      controls on this tab will be available. You do have to select a MIME
      type for each attachment, but the description is optional - although it
      is a good idea to always provide a description. This makes it easier for
      others to identify what you've attached to this Matroska file.</p>

     <p>The last option, <code>attachment style</code>, is only evaluated when
      you also split the output into several files. (Splitting in general is
      explained in the following section.) If the option <code>To all
      files</code> is selected then the current file will be attached to all
      output files created. If the option <code>Only to the first</code> is
      selected then the file is only attached to the very first output file
      created.</p>

     <h4><a name="global_split">3.5.2. Automatic splitting and file
       linking </a></h4>

     <p>The <code>Split</code> section handles how the output file is split
      into several smaller files. If no splitting is selected then only one
      big file is generated. If splitting is activated then you can tell
      <i>mkvmerge</i> to start a new output file after either a specific
      amount of data has been written to the current file or after a specific
      amount of time has accumulated. The formats accepted are:
      <br>
      <ul>
       <li>For the size: A number optionally followed by the letter 'K', 'M'
        or 'G' indicating kilobytes (1024 bytes), megabytes (1024 * 1024
        bytes) or gigabytes (1024 * 1024 * 1024 bytes). Examples: '700M' or
        '100000K'.</li>

       <li>For the time: The format is either <code>HH:MM:SS</code> or a
        number followed by the letter 's' indicating a number of
        seconds. Examples: '01:20:00' (split after 1 hour, 20 minutes) or
        '1800s' (split after 1800 seconds = 30 minutes).</li>
      </ul>
     </p>

     <p><code>Don't link:</code> This option controls how <i>mkvmerge</i> will
      handle splitting. A little explanation about this feature:</p>

     <p>Matroska supports file linking which simply says that a specific file
      is the predecessor or successor of the current file. To be precise, it's
      not really the files that are linked but the Matroska segments. As most
      files will probably only contain one Matroska segment I simply say 'file
      linking' although 'segment linking' would be more appropriate.</p>

     <p>Each segment is identified by a unique 128 bit wide segment UID. This
      UID is automatically generated by <i>mkvmerge</i>. The linking is done
      primarily via putting the segment UIDs of the previous/next file into
      the segment header information. <i>mkvinfo</i> prints these UIDs if it
      finds them.</p>

     <p>If a file is split into several smaller ones and linking is used then
      the time codes will not start at 0 again but will continue where the
      last file has left off. This way the absolute time is kept even if the
      previous files are not available (e.g. when streaming). If no linking is
      used then the time codes should start at 0 for each file. By default
      <i>mkvmerge</i> uses file linking. If you don't want that you
      can turn it off by enabling this <code>Don't link</code>
      check box.</p>

     <h4><a name="global_link">3.5.3. Manual file/segment linking</a></h4>

     <p>Regardless of whether splitting is active or not the user can tell
      <i>mkvmerge</i> to link the produced files to specific
      UIDs. This is done by entering a valid segment UID into the
      two input boxes, <code>Previous segment UID</code> and
      <code>Next segment UID</code>.  These options accept a segment
      UID in the format that <i>mkvinfo</i> outputs: 16 hexadecimal
      numbers between 0x00 and 0xff prefixed with '0x' each and
      separated with spaces, e.g. <code>0x41 0xda 0x73 0x66 0xd9
       0xcf 0xb2 0x1e 0xae 0x78 0xeb 0xb4 0x5e 0xca 0xb3
       0x93</code>. Alternatively a shorter form can be used: 16
      hexadecimal numbers between 0x00 and 0xff without the '0x'
      prefixes and without the spaces, e.g.
      <code>41da7366d9cfb21eae78ebb45ecab393</code>.</p>

     <p>If splitting is used then the first file is linked to the UID given in
      the <code>Previous segment UID</code> input box, and the last file is
      linked to the UID given in the <code>Next segment UID</code> input
      box. If splitting is not used then the one output file will be linked to
      both of the two UIDs.</p>

     <h4><a name="global_chapters">3.5.4. Chapters</a></h4>

     <p>With the browse button you can select the chapters to add to the
      output file. A full explanation of all aspects around chapters can be
      found in the <a href="mkvmerge-gui.html#chaptereditor"> Chapter editor
      section</a>.</p>

     <h4><a name="global_tags">3.5.5. Global tags</a></h4>

     <p>Unlike the tags you can select for each track on the input tab the
      tags selected here have to contain the track UIDs. These tags are not
      assigned to any track automatically. In 99% of all cases this is NOT the
      option you want to use!</p>

     <p>The full explanation can be found in
      <a href="mkvmerge.html">mkvmerge's documentation</a>.</p>

     <p>Once everything has been set up the muxing process can be started. The
      last thing to do is to chose where to mux to. With the
      <code>browse</code> button you can select the output file. After this
      has been done hit the <code>Start muxing</code> button or select the
      same entry from the <code>Muxing</code> menu.</p>

     <p>If everything has been set up correctly <i>mmg</i> will show the
      muxing dialog. The progress is shown at the top, as is a general
      description of what <i>mkvmerge</i> is doing at the moment (muxing, 1st
      pass of splitting files or 2nd pass of splitting files).</p>

     <p><i>mkvmerge</i> knows three different 'severity levels' for its
      messages: status reports, warnings and errors. All status report
      messages are shown in the upper window. These include the track types
      encountered and other interesting things.</p>

     <p>Warnings are shown in the middle window. <i>mkvmerge</i> will not
      abort when it issues a warning, but it might stop muxing the track for
      which the warning was printed. You should pay close attention to all
      warning messages.</p>

     <p>Errors are show in the lower window. Errors are always fatal, and
      <i>mkvmerge</i> will stop muxing right after it has printed the error
      message. Such a message might be that the hard disc is full or that the
      source file is damaged and cannot be processed any further.</p>

     <p>The button <code>Abort</code> sends <i>mkvmerge</i> the signal to stop
      muxing. Unless <i>mkvmerge</i> is stuck in some endless loop it will
      stop soon after you've pressed the button. With <code>Save log</code>
      you can save the complete output from <i>mkvmerge</i> into a text file

  <h3><a name="saveload">3.7. Saving and loading muxing settings</a></h3>

  <p>All your hard work of setting options does not have to be lost when you
   exit the program. You can save all your muxing settings into text based
   configuration files with the <code>Save settings</code> option in the
   <code>File</code> menu and restore them later with the <code>Load
   settings</code> option. The default extension is <code>.mmg</code> and is
   usually not used by other programs. You can also associate this extension
   with <i>mmg</i> so that it automatically loads the settings if it is called
   with the name of such a settings file.</p>

  <h2><a name="chaptereditor">4. The chapter editor</a></h2>

  <p>One of the new features of <i>mmg</i> is a full-featured chapter
   editor. It can read text based chapter files, import chapters from existing
   Matroska files, write text based chapter files that can be selected on the
   global tab and write chapters directly to existing Matroska files.</p>

  <h3><a name="chapterconcept">4.1. Matroska's chapter concept</a></h3>

  <p>Unlike a lot of other systems Matroska supports <i>nested</i>
   chapters. This basically means that you can define sub chapters for
   chapters.</p>

  <p>A chapter entity in Matroska consists of at least four items: The UID of
   the track(s) it applies to, the chapter title/name, it's start time and the
   language code associated with it. Additional elements are optional and
   include the end time, more language codes and country codes. Usually the
   user will only need the mandatory elements. Of these he can only specify
   the name, the start time and the language code. <i>mkvmerge</i> will then
   automatically assign all chapters to the complete file.</p>

  <h3><a name="chapterexamples">4.2. Examples</a></h3>

  <p>The first example is a simple one. The movie in question contains four
   parts: The intro starting at the beginning, the first act, the second act,
   and the credits. Note that the end timestamps are optional.</p>

  <p><code>Intro (from 00:00:00, language English)
    <br>
    Act 1 (from 00:01:00, language English)
    <br>
    Act 2 (from 00:05:30, language English)
    <br>
    Credits (from 00:12:20 until 00;12:55, language English)</code></p>

  <p>A more complex example including sub chapters. Let's take Ludwig van
   Beethoven's opera Fidelio. For the sake of brevity I'm only including the
   first three pieces of the two acts.</p>

  <p>The first act contains:
   <ol>
    <li>Overt&uuml;re (6:24 long),</li>
    <li>Arie: 'Jetzt, Sch&auml;tzchen, jetzt sind wir allein' (4:46
     long) and</li>
    <li>Dialog: 'Armer Jaquino' (0:10 long).</li>
   </ol>
   The second act contains:
   <ol>
    <li>Ouvert&uuml;re und Arie: 'Gott! welch Dunkel hier!' (10:46
     long),</li>
    <li>Melodrama und Duett: 'Wie kalt ist es' (5:21 long) and</li>
    <li>Dialog: 'Er erwacht!' (0:59 long).</li>
   </ol>
  </p>

  <p>The first act, which will be our first chapter, has a combined length of
   11:20. Our second act has a length of 17:06. These chapters would look like
   this:</p>

  <p><code>Erster Akt (from 00:00:00 until 00:11:20, language German,
    country Germany)
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ouvert&uuml;re (from 00:00:00 until 00:06:24, language
    German, country Germany)
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arie: 'Jetzt, Sch&auml;tzchen, jetzt sind wir allein'
    (from 00:06:24 until 00:11:10, language German, country Germany)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dialog: 'Armer Jaquino' (from 00:11:10 until 00:11:20,
    language German, country Germany)
    <br>

    Zweiter Akt (from 00:11:20 until 00:28:26, language German,
    country Germany)
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ouvert&uuml;re und Arie: 'Gott! welch Dunkel hier!'
    (from 00:11:20 until 00:22:06, language German, country Germany)
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Melodrama und Duett: 'Wie kalt ist es' (from 00:22:06
    until 00:27:27, language German, country Germany)
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dialog: 'Er erwacht!' (from 00:27:27 until 00:28:26,
    language German, country Germany)
   </code>
  </p>

  <h3><a name="chapterformats">4.3. Chapter formats supported by mkvmerge
  </a></h3>

  <p><i>mkvmerge</i> and <i>mmg</i>'s chapter editor both support different
   formats for chapter files.</p>

  <h4><a name="cfsimple">4.3.1. Simple/OGM style chapter files</a></h4>

  <p>One of the most basic formats is the format used in OGM files. It is a
   text based format. Each chapter entry contains of two lines, the first
   containing the start time, the second the chapter's title/name. All lines
   are numbered.</p>

  <p>The first example from above can be expressed in this format:<br>
   <code>CHAPTER01=00:00:00.000<br>
    CHAPTER01NAME=Intro<br>
    CHAPTER02=00:01:00.000<br>
    CHAPTER02NAME=Act 1<br>
    CHAPTER03=00:05:30.000<br>
    CHAPTER03NAME=Act 2<br>
    CHAPTER04=00:12:20.000<br>
    CHAPTER04NAME=Credits
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>The second example cannot be expressed in this format because it supports
   neither language specifications nor end times or nested chapters. The
   advantage is that such files are very easy to create, and there are several
   tools available for both Windows and Unix/Linux that create such files
   directly from DVDs.</p>

  <p>Due to its limitations <i>mmg</i> cannot output chapters in this
   format.</p>

  <h4><a name="cfxml">4.3.2. Full-featured XML style chapter files</a></h4>

  <p>I've created a XML based chapter format that closely matches the system
   Matroska uses. With this format you have the full control over all
   features. I won't describe this format here in detail. Please have a look
   at the example XML chapter files that came with <i>mkvtoolnix</i>.</p>

  <h4><a name="cfkax">4.3.3. Chapters found in Matroska files</a></h4>

  <p>The chapter editor can read chapters directly from Matroska files. These
   can be written to XML chapter files or back to the same Matroska file or
   another Matroska file. All features are supported.</p>

  <h3><a name="creatingchapters">4.4. Creating chapter files</a></h3>

  <table width="100%" border="0">
   <tr>
    <td valign="top">
     <p>The chapter editor consists of three parts: the tree view of all
      chapters, the four buttons used for adding and removing chapter entries,
      and the input boxes which are used for setting the chapter entry's
      data.</p>

     <p>In Matroska files one chapter is defined by having a start time, a
      name and a language that is associated with that name. You can have
      several names for one chapter and each associated with a different
      language. You may also add an end time, but that is not mandatory.</p>

     <p>A new chapter file is started with the <code>New</code> option from
      the <code>Chapter editor</code> menu. You can add a new chapter with the
      <code>Add chapter</code> or <code>Add subchapter</code> buttons. The
      difference between these two buttons is that when a chapter has been
      selected <code>Add chapter</code> will append a new chapter directly
      after the selected chapter on the same level, and <code>Add
      subchapter</code> will add a new chapter as the last child of the
      currently selected chapter.</p>

     <p>The <code>Remove chapter</code> has to be used with care. It removes
      the complete subtree without asking for confirmation, and there is no
      undo option available at the moment.</p>

     <p>After selecting a chapter entry you can change its data. The format
      for the start and end time are either <code>HH:MM:SS.mmm</code> or
      simply <code>HH:MM:SS</code>. One chapter name will already have been
      added. You can edit it and select the language that this name is given
      in. This way you could provide names in several languages, e.g. 'The
      hero arrives' with 'eng' as the language and 'Der Held kommt an' with
      'ger' as the language. Just hit the <code>Add name</code> button if you
      need more entries and <code>Remove name</code> in order to get rid of
      one.</p>

     <p>Creating many chapters and always changing the language can be quite
      some work. Therefore you can select which language and country tags
      <i>mmg</i> should add by default with the <code>Set default
      values</code> menu entry in the <code>Chapters</code> menu. The
      <code>Set values</code> button does something similar. With it you can
      apply a language and/or country to the currently selected entry and all
      its children.</p>

     <p>Saving chapters to XML files can be done with <code>Save</code> or
      <code>Save as</code>. <code>Save as</code> cannot be used to write
      chapters to an existing Matroska file - you'll have to use <code>Save to
      Matroska file</code> for that.</p>
