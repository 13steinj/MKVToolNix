  <p><b>Matroska</b> aims to become THE Standard of Multimedia Container
  Formats. It was derived from a project called MCF, but differentiates
  from it significantly because it is based on EBML (Extensible Binary
  Meta Language), a binary derivative of XML. EBML enables the Matroska
  Development Team to gain significant advantages in terms of future
  format extensibility, without breaking file support in old
  parsers.</p>

  href="http://www.matroska.org/">Matroska's homepage</a>.</p>

  <h3>
    <a name="whatismkvmerge">What is mkvmerge? What is mkvmerge
      GUI?
    </a>
  </h3>

  <p><i>mkvmerge</i> and <i>mkvmerge GUI</i> (or just <i>mmg</i>) are
  two programs created by <a href="mailto:moritz@bunkus.org">Moritz
  Bunkus</a>. They're part of the <i>mkvtoolnix</i>
  package. <i>mkvmerge</i> can read a lot of different multimedia files
  and put their contents into Matroska files. Unfortunately this is a
  command line program, and not everyone is comfortable working on the
  command line. This is where <i>mkvmerge GUI</i> comes into play. It is
  a GUI that provides the user with an intuitive but powerful interface
  to <i>mkvmerge</i>.</p>

  <p>Both programs are available for both Windows and GNU/Linux and
  other Unix derivatives. The program is licensed under the GPL, so the
  source code is available to anyone interested.</p>

  <h3><a name="latestversion">Obtaining the latest version</a></h3>

  <p>You can always find the latest version of <i>mkvtoolnix</i> on
  <a href="http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/">Moritz Bunkus'
  website</a>. Windows users will have to download the runtime DLLs as
  well as the <i>mkvtoolnix</i> binaries. Linux/Unix users will probably
  download the sources and compile <i>mkvtoolnix</i> themselves.</p>

  <h3><a name="scope">Scope of this guide</a></h3>

  <p>This guide only focusses on the GUI part of these tools. All
  command line options are explained in detail in <i>mkvmerge</i>'s man
  page/HTML page.</p>

  <h2><a name="setup">Setting up mkvmerge GUI</a></h2>

  <p>(<i>Note: This section does not cover compilation and
  installation. mkvmerge's own documentation and the
  <code>README</code> files that are included in the <i>mkvtoolnix</i>
  package.</i>)</p>

  <p>The only thing that <i>mmg</i> needs to know is the location of the
  <i>mkvmerge</i> binary. Under normal circumstances it will be found
  automatically. But if not then you can select the binary to use on the
  <i>Settings</i> tab.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2><a name="muxing">Creating Matroska files</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="basics">Basics</a></h3>

  <p><i>mkvmerge</i> strictly differentiates between <i>files</i> and
  <i>tracks</i>. An input <i>file</i> usually contains one or more
  <i>tracks</i>. <i>mkvmerge</i> needs at least one input file and the
  file name of the Matroska file it should create before it can do any
  work. Starting with this minimal set of options the user can add more
  input files, select advanced options for each track, apply some more
  global options etc.</p>

  <p>The typical basic steps are:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>Select some input <i>files</i>,</li>
    <li>set language options for the <i>tracks</i>,</li>
    <li>set the movie/file title,</li>
    <li>select the file to write to and</li>
    <li>start the muxing process.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <p>When <i>mmg</i> starts up it shows the first and probably most
  important tab: the <i>input tab</i>. Here you see four different
  elements. The topmost input box lists all input <i>files</i>. Directly
  under this box are options that apply to the currently selected input
  <i>file</i>.</p>

  <p>The two buttons to the right of the upper list box can be used to
  add files to the list box with the <i>+</i> button and to remove the
  selected entry with the <i>-</i> button.</p>

  <p>Once the user selects an input <i>file</i> in the upper list box
  the second list box will contains all <i>tracks</i> that can be read
  from this <i>file</i>. For each of these tracks the user can select
  track specific options with the input boxes and check boxes below the
  track listing. These options will be described in the following
  sections.</p>

  <h3><a name="fileoptions">Options for input file</a></h3>

  <p>Once the user has added and selected an input file he can set
  options that apply to this specific file. At the moment only one such
  option has been implemented: <code>No chapters</code>. If this option
  is checked then <i>mkvmerge</i> will not try to copy chapters from
  this source file. More information about chapters can be found in the
  section about the <a href="mkvmerge-gui.html#chaptereditor">chapter
  editor</a> in this document and in <i>mkvmerge</i>'s own
  documentation.</p>

  <h3><a name="trackoptions">Options for each track</a></h3>

  <p>Depending on the type of the currently selected track (audio,
  video, subtitles) and even depending on the contents of the track only
  a subset of all the track specific options are availbale. The options
  are:
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li><code>Language:</code> The user can select the language for each
    track regardless of its type. This language is coded in the ISO639-2
    language code. The drop-down box contains all ISO639-2 codes so the
    user does not have to worry about selecting the wrong language
    code.</li>
    <li><code>Track name:</code> The user can set a name for the current
    track. This name is a free-form string. Practical examples could be
    'director's comments' or 'aeriel view of Seattle'. Note that these
    names are not meant to contain the movie title!</li>
    <li><code>Cues:</code> The <i>cues</i> are for Matroska what the
    index is for AVI files. They contain links to the key
    frames. Usually this option should be left on the value
    'default'. <i>mkvmerge</i> will automatically chose the best method
    for any given track type. A full explanantion of tracks can be found
    in <i>mkvmerge</i>'s documentation.</li>
    <li><code>Aspect ratio:</code> With this option the user can set the
    aspect ratio that should be used upon playback. It defaults to the
    aspect ratio that the movie was encoded with but can be changed,
    e.g. for anamorphic encodings. The GUI expects the format to be
    either a floating point number (e.g. '2.33') or a fraction
    (e.g. '16/9').
    <br>
    This option is only available for video tracks.</li>
    <li><code>FourCC:</code> Matroska does not normally store the FourCC
    which is used in other containers to identify the codec
    used. Matroska has its own format, called <i>CodecID</i>, but it
    also has an AVI compatibility mode. In thise mode the FourCC is also
    stored. With this option the FourCC can be forced to a different
    value. However, you cannot change the <i>CodecID</i> used by
    <i>mkvmerge</i>.
    <br>
    This option is only available for video tracks.</li>
    <li><code>Delay (in ms):</code> In some cases audio and video are
    not synchronized properly. With this option the user can offset the
    audio track by a given amount, either positive or
    negative. <i>mkvmerge</i> will either remove samples at the
    beginning or insert silence at the beginning to adjust the track.
    <br>
    This option is available for audio and text subtitle tracks.</li>
    <li><code>Stretch by:</code> In some cases audio and video slowly
    drift apart during playback. This can be fixed by supplying a factor
    of how much the timecodes should be stretched by <i>mkvmerge</i>. If
    nothing is given then '1.0' is assumed which does not alter the
    timecodes. Please note that this option has not been implemented for
    all audio track types yet.
    <br>
    This option is available for audio and text subtitle tracks.</li>
    <li><code>Subtitle charset:</code> Some text subtitle formats do not
    store the charset that they were creted with. This is important
    because text subtitles are auomatically converted to the UTF-8
    charset during muxing. <i>mkvmerge</i> will normally assume that the
    system's current charset is the same that the subtitle file was
    written in. But in case this is not true the user can select the
    correct charset.
    <br>
    This option is only available for text subtitle tracks.</li>
    <li><code>Make default track:</code> Matroska knows a flag which
    tells the player that a specific track should be preferred upon
    playback if the user does not chose another one. Of course each
    track <i>type</i> has its own default track - e.g. the default audio
    track is the English one, and the default subtitle track is the
    French one. If no track is set to be the default track then
    <i>mkvmerge</i> will promote the first track of each type that it
    finds to be the default track. This is consistent with the behaviour
    of various media players.</li>
    <li><code>AAC is SBR/HE-AAC/AAC+:</code> The new technology called
    'high efficiency AAC' has some drawbacks when it is being stored in
    <code>.AAC</code> files: it is not possible to detect the HE-AAC
    part for these files. Therefore the user has to check this option
    manually if it applies. Please note that this problem does not exist
    for HE-AAC stored in <code>.MP4</code> files.</li>
  </ul>
