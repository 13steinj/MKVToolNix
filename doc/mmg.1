.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBmmg\fR is a wxWindows based GUI for \fBmkvmerge\fR. It offers easy
access to all of \fBmkvmerge\fR's options. All settings (e.g. source
files, track options etc) can be saved and restored.  Included is a
chapter editor that can read OGM style and XML style chapter files,
write XML style chapter files and even read chapters from Matroska
files and write chapters directly to Matroska files.
.LP
\fBmmg\fR knows few options. The first possibility is to start it with
a single file name. If that file name's extenion is '\fI.mmg\fR' then
it will be treated as a preferences file and \fBmmg\fR will load its
setting when it starts. Otherwise the name is interpreted as being
the name of an input file which will be added.
.LP
The second operation mode is invoked with the
option '\-\-edit\-headers' and a file name. This lets \fBmmg\fR run
its header editor and load the file.
.LP
The full documentation is available in HTML form (doc/mkvmerge-gui.html).
