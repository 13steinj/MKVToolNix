2003-04-17 19:23  mosu

	* mkvinfo.cpp: Support for KaxReferenceBlock and KaxBlockDuration.

2003-04-17 19:01  mosu

	* mkvmerge.cpp, pr_generic.cpp, pr_generic.h: KaxInfo are now
	rendered correctly and filled with useful information
	(KaxTimecodeScale and KaxDuration). The latter is updated after
	writing the complete file in order to have the correct length
	available.

2003-04-17 18:19  mosu

	* p_video.cpp: Preliminary support for KaxTrackMinCache and
	*MaxCache - fixed to 1 at the moment.

2003-04-17 18:18  mosu

	* mkvinfo.cpp: Support for the movie duration (KaxDuration under
	the segment infos).

2003-04-17 17:58  mosu

	* mkvinfo.cpp: Support for KaxMinCache and KaxMaxCache.

2003-04-17 15:28  mosu

	* acinclude.m4: Removed the C profiling library from the
	--enable-profiling options. Now only -pg is being added to the
	CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS.

2003-04-17 15:27  mosu

	* pr_generic.cpp, pr_generic.h: Removed the "rendered" flag from
	the packets as the clusters already contain such a flag. Speedup by
	storing the last freed reference ID in the packetizer. This way the
	cluster/packet list is only walked after rendering a cluster and
	not for each packet that is being added.

2003-04-17 14:36  mosu

	* .cvsignore: Added data directory.

2003-04-17 14:36  mosu

	* r_wav.cpp: Fixed the process calls - the third parameter is not
	the "last_frame" flag anymore but the timecode.

2003-04-17 14:35  mosu

	* r_matroska.cpp: Some namespace fixes/cleanups. Removed
	KaxBlockAdditional which has been removed from the specs. Operator
	!= not defined, so changed to !(... == ...).

2003-04-17 14:31  mosu

	* r_avi.cpp, r_ogm.cpp: Set ti->private_data to NULL. Otherwise
	data would be freed twice in the end.

2003-04-17 14:30  mosu

	* r_ac3.cpp, r_mp3.cpp: Fixed the process calls - the third
	parameter is not the "last_frame" flag anymore but the timecode.

2003-04-17 14:29  mosu

	* queue.cpp: More sanity checks.

2003-04-17 14:28  mosu

	* pr_generic.h: New variable for the packets: "rendered" which is
	set to 1 as soon as AddFrame has been called for that packet.

2003-04-17 14:27  mosu

	* pr_generic.cpp: Mandatory fixes for the new libmatroska code:
	Timecodes are always absolute and in ns; AddFrame is called on
	clusters not on block groups anymore; cluster timecodes do not have
	to be set manually anymore. New variable for the packets:
	"rendered" which is set to 1 as soon as AddFrame has been called
	for that packet.

2003-04-17 14:23  mosu

	* p_pcm.cpp: Explicit type conversion in order to avoid compiler
	warnings.

2003-04-17 14:22  mosu

	* p_mp3.cpp: Removed the default value from the function
	definition.

2003-04-17 14:22  mosu

	* mkvmerge.cpp: Added KaxTimecodeScale with its default value
	(mandatory for the new libmatroska).

2003-04-17 14:21  mosu

	* common.h: Added trace() function in order to ease the debugging
	process. #define for the standard timecode scale added.

2003-04-17 14:21  mosu

	* common.cpp: Added trace() function in order to ease the debugging
	process.

2003-04-17 14:10  mosu

	* avilib/avilib.c: Fixed an inavlid access to non-allocated space
	if there is some private data after the WAVEFORMATEX structure in
	the AVI.

2003-04-16 22:10  mosu

	* mkvinfo.cpp: Necessary changes to the reading process regarding
	timecodes.

2003-04-13 17:44  mosu

	* pr_generic.cpp: libebml now takes absolute timecodes for
	AddFrame.

	r_microdvd.cpp, r_microdvd.h, r_mp3.cpp, r_mp3.h, r_ogm.cpp,
	r_ogm.h, r_srt.cpp, r_srt.h, r_vobsub.cpp, r_vobsub.h, r_wav.cpp,
	r_wav.h: Changed all u_int64_t to int64_t. Some crappy MS compilers
	obviously cannot convert u_int64_t to double. And I do not need
	them that badly.

2003-04-13 16:00  mosu

	* acinclude.m4, mkvinfo.cpp, mkvmerge.cpp: Renamed GCC2 to
	LIBEBML_GCC2 as GCC2 seemed to be too general a term to be used in
	other programs.

2003-04-11 17:28  mosu

	* mkvmerge.cpp: #ifdef to make mkvmerge.cpp compile under Windows
	from Shelly.

2003-04-11 17:18  mosu

	* acinclude.m4: Simplified the gcc version check.

2003-04-11 15:44  mosu

	* subtitles.cpp: New style process support.

2003-04-11 13:52  mosu

	* r_ogm.cpp: Stream selection based on the serial number, not the
	stream number. Removed deprecated parameters from various
	packetizers. Renamed "stream" to "track" where appropriate. Unified
	and simplified demuxing and handling of the different stream types.

2003-04-11 13:37  mosu

	* r_mp3.cpp: Removed deprecated parameters from MP3 packetizers.

2003-04-11 13:36  mosu

	argument from the AC3 packetizer. Introduced frame type flags (I,
	P). New style process support. Unified audio reading and processing
	(PCM, MP3, AC3).

2003-04-11 13:30  mosu

	* r_ac3.cpp: Removed the bitrate from the AC3 packetizer arguments.

2003-04-11 13:29  mosu

2003-04-11 13:29  mosu

	* p_vorbis.cpp: New style "process" function support. Lacing now
	reports two packets laced, the third one is stored implicitly.

	flags (I, P, B) introduced.

2003-04-11 13:27  mosu

	* p_video.cpp: New style "process" function support. New frame type
	flags (I, P, B) introduced, although only I and P frames are
	handled at the moment.

2003-04-11 13:23  mosu

	* p_textsubs.cpp: New style "process" function support. Some
	explicit char* typecasts.

2003-04-11 13:19  mosu

	the supplied timecode or calculate the timecode itself.

2003-04-11 12:36  mosu

	'set_parameters' function.

2003-04-11 12:32  mosu

	* p_ac3.cpp: Renamed 'stream' to 'track'. Removed the useless
	function 'set_parameters'. process now either uses the supplied
	timecode or calculates it on its own if timecode == -1.

2003-04-11 12:19  mosu

	* mkvmerge.cpp: Very, very early support for Matroska files.
	General looping is implemented, the packetizers are created, but
	the data is not being read and processed. Just a commit to make the
	whole thing compile.

2003-04-11 12:05  mosu

	* common.cpp, common.h: Renamed all variables with "streams" to
	"*tracks" as "track" is the correct Matroska term.

2003-04-11 12:03  mosu

	* r_matroska.cpp, r_matroska.h: Very, very early support for
	Matroska files. General looping is implemented, the packetizers are
	created, but the data is not being read and processed. Just a
	commit to make the whole thing compile.

2003-04-11 11:56  mosu

	* Makefile.am, acinclude.m4, configure.in: New parameters
	--with-ebml-* that reflect the separation of libebml from
	libmatroska.

2003-04-09 15:34  mosu

	to common.cpp.

	3.2

2003-03-13 10:27  mosu

	Added support for a Matroska reader.

2003-03-13 10:25  mosu

	* p_ac3.cpp, p_mp3.cpp, p_pcm.cpp, p_video.cpp, p_vorbis.cpp:
	Renamed the variables track_video and track_audio to simply
	video/audio as track_video and track_audio are already used as
	track type enumerations by libmatroska.

2003-03-05 18:44  mosu

	* common.h, mkvmerge.cpp, p_pcm.cpp, p_pcm.h, p_video.cpp,
	p_video.h, r_avi.cpp, r_ogm.cpp: Moved fourcc into track_info_t.

	r_srt.h, r_vobsub.cpp, r_vobsub.h, r_wav.cpp, r_wav.h: Removed
	range processing. This is a left-over from the days when there was
	no ogmsplit.

2003-03-04 00:21  mosu

	* p_video.h: Small annoying bug - default value is -1 not 0 (-1
	meaning that the packtizer will have to calculate the timecodes
	itself).

2003-03-04 00:20  mosu

	* p_vorbis.cpp, p_vorbis.h, r_ogm.cpp, r_ogm.h: Working Vorbis

	been read.

2003-03-03 14:47  mosu

	* acinclude.m4, common.h, mkvmerge.cpp, r_ogm.cpp, r_ogm.h: Added

	* .cvsignore: Added config.h

2003-02-28 19:54  mosu
