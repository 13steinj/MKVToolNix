2003-08-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * mkvmerge: Fixed support for reading MultiComment tags from
        XML tag files.

        * mkvmerge: Allow some slightly broken Matroska files to be
        processed correctly if the reference blocks are off by at most 1ms.

2003-08-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * mkvmerge: MP3: Better support for other MPEG versions and layers
        (number of samples per packet).

        * mkvmerge: RealVideo: Support for "merged" frames.

        * mkvinfo: Added Adler32 calculation and display for frame
        contents with the -c option.

        * mkvmerge: RealAudio: "dnet" is actually byte-swapped AC3 and is
        being treated as such (re-swapped and output as AC3).

        * mkvmerge: Fixed a bug with chapters and splitting which would
        crash mkvmerge if no chapter belonged into the output file.

2003-08-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Changes for compilation with gcc 2.95.

2003-08-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Released v0.6.0.

2003-07-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        binary elements in the tags.

2003-07-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * mkvextract: Support for extracting chapter information.

        * mkvmerge: Added support for simple chapter files (CHAPTER01=...,
        CHAPTER01NAME=Hello World etc).

2003-07-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * mkvmerge: Added support tags based on XML files.

        * mkvextract: Rewrote the command line syntax. Added extracting
        attachments and tags as new options.

        * mkvmerge: Fixed a bug in the SRT reader which would not always
        handle Unix/DOS style new line cases correctly.

2003-07-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * mkvmerge: Added support for the "SegmentTitle" (general title of
        the file written).

2003-07-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * mkvmerge: Added support for UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoded text files
        for the SRT and SSA/ASS readers.

2003-07-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * mkvmerge: The SSA/ASS reader ignored the --sub-charset option
        and always used the current charset to recode the subtitles.

2003-07-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * mkvmerge: Added support for attaching files to the output
        file(s).

        * mkvinfo: Support for the elements dealing with attachments
        (KaxAttachments, KaxAttached, KaxFileDescription, KaxFileName,
        KaxMimeType, KaxFileData).

2003-07-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * mkvmerge: Changed the RealVideo packaging method: Subpackets are
        assembled into complete packets so the demuxer does not have to do
        that anymore.

        * mkvmerge: DisplayWidth and DisplayHeight, which form the display
        aspect ratio, are now always written to ease changing them later
        without having to completely remux the file.

2003-07-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * mkvmerge: Fixed some infinite-reading-from-a-file bug that
        occured on Windows when reading SSA/ASS files.

        * mkvmerge: Fixed a bug which would mostly appear with subtitles
        that have very long ( > 60s) gaps between entries. Here the
        cluster would not been rendered properly leaving mkvmerge either
        comatose ( = endless loop) or just plain dead ( = crashing).

2003-07-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * mkvinfo: Added support for the rest of the tags:
        KaxTagMultiComment, KaxTagMultiCommentName,
        KaxTagMultiCommentComments and KaxTagMultiCommentLanguage. Almost
        all tags have been successfully tested.

2003-07-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Added a RealMedia demuxer that can handle both RealVideo and
        RealAudio (all codecs).

        frames) when reading Matroska files.

        * mkvmerge: Implemented time slice durations , default block
        duration and block durations for slices where necessary.

        * Added 'ReferencePriority' element to the known elements for
        mkvinfo.

        * Removed "(mkvinfo) " from mkvinfo's output in order to improve
        readability and save space.

        * --sub-charset now also needs a track ID.

        * Modified the verbosity levels for mkvinfo: The seek head subentries
        and cue subentries will only be shown at level 2 to make the 
        output easier to read. 

        * The language and default track settings are now kept again if
        not overridden when reading from Matroska files.

2003-06-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Added mkvextract which can extract tracks from a Matroska file
        into other files.

2003-06-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Switched from cygwin to MinGW32 for the Windows binaries.

        resulted in a segfault sometimes.

        * Added a SSA/ASS reader.

2003-06-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Support for reading text subtitles from Matroska files.

        contains the emphasis header (deprecated) or not (current standard).

2003-06-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Released v0.4.4.

        * Several options now need an explicity track ID to specify
        which tracks of an input file the option should be applied
        to. These options include --atracks, --vtracks, --stracks, --sync,
        --default-track, --cues and --language.

        * The Matroska reader now handles track selection correctly.

2003-06-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Added an option for identifying input files and their track types.

2003-06-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Released v0.4.3.

2003-06-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Support for proper linking of segments via the segment UIDs. The
        first and last files created can be manually linked to given UIDs.

2003-06-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Added support for splitting output files by size or by time and

2003-05-31  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Some improvements to the mkvinfo GUI (thanks to jcsston for the

2003-05-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Released v0.4.2.

        * Support for some more tags in both mkvmerge and mkvinfo.

        * Fixed a segfault in the Matroska reader.

        * Removed the '--sub-type' switch as all text subtitles will be
        stored in UTF-8 format. Made iconv mandatory in the configure
        checks for this very reason.

        * Added a GUI to mkvinfo.

        and libmatroska 0.4.3 now.

2003-05-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * ADTS headers are stripped from the AAC streams. This is what I'd
        call 'proper AAC support'.

2003-05-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Better support for DTS streams in general and for DTS-in-WAV in
        particular (patch by Peter Niemayer <niemayer AT isg.de>).

2003-05-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        round making seeking not really nice ;)

2003-05-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Fixed a bug with the AC3 timecode calculation (patch by Peter
        Niemayer <niemayer AT isg.de>).

        * Support for reading DTS files & putting them into Matroska
        (main patch by Peter Niemayer <niemayer AT isg.de>, a few things
        by me).

        * Released v0.3.2.

        * Fixed the huge memory need if reading from AVI files (introduced
        on 2003-05-06 with the internal changes).

        * Proper handling of the 'default track' flag and the language for
        the Matroska reader.

        * Proper handling of the 'default track' flag for all the packetizers.

        * A lot of internal changes - I hope nothing has broken... (See
        ChangeLog.cvs for details.)

        * The matroska reader calculated wrong header lengths for Vorbis
        tracks.

2003-05-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * mkvinfo reports the FourCC for video tracks with a 
        CodecID of V_MS/VFW/FOURCC and the format tag for audio tracks
        with a CodecID of A_MS/ACM.

2003-05-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Released v0.3.1.
