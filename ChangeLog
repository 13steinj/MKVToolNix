2003-05-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Removed the '--sub-type' switch as all text subtitles will be
        stored in UTF-8 format. Made iconv mandatory in the configure
        checks for this very reason.

        * Added a GUI to mkvinfo.

2003-05-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Released v0.4.1.

        * A lot of changes regarding file I/O. Files bigger than 2GB
        should now be handled correctly on both Linux and Windows.

2003-05-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Added checks for MP4/Quicktime files which will abort mkvmerge.

        * Support for reading AAC tracks from Matroska files.

        * Released v0.4.0.

2003-05-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Some internal changes and enhancements. Code requires libebml
        and libmatroska 0.4.3 now.

2003-05-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * ADTS headers are stripped from the AAC streams. This is what I'd
        call 'proper AAC support'.

2003-05-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Better support for DTS streams in general and for DTS-in-WAV in
        particular (patch by Peter Niemayer <niemayer AT isg.de>).

2003-05-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Renamed '--no-utf8-subs' to '--sub-type utf8'. Polished the man
        page regarding subtitle handling.

        * Fixed a bug with mono MP3 files.

        * Added support for AAC files (only those with ADTS headers at the
        moment).

2003-05-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Released v0.3.3.

        * If an error occurs while writing to the destination file the
        error is reported and mkvmerge aborts with a non-zero exit code.

        * The OGM reader reported I frames as P frames and vice versa
        round making seeking not really nice ;)

2003-05-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Fixed a bug with the AC3 timecode calculation (patch by Peter
        Niemayer <niemayer AT isg.de>).

        * Support for reading DTS files & putting them into Matroska
        (main patch by Peter Niemayer <niemayer AT isg.de>, a few things
        by me).

        * Released v0.3.2.

        * Fixed the huge memory need if reading from AVI files (introduced
        on 2003-05-06 with the internal changes).

        * Proper handling of the 'default track' flag and the language for
        the Matroska reader.

        * Proper handling of the 'default track' flag for all the packetizers.

2003-05-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Made mkvtoolnix compile under cygwin.

2003-05-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Added support for aspect ratio.

        * Subtitle charsets can be specified with --sub-charset and do not
        rely on the current locale anymore.

        * For the last packet of each track its duration is now stored.

        * A lot of internal changes - I hope nothing has broken... (See
        ChangeLog.cvs for details.)

        * The matroska reader calculated wrong header lengths for Vorbis
        tracks.

2003-05-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * mkvinfo reports the FourCC for video tracks with a 
        CodecID of V_MS/VFW/FOURCC and the format tag for audio tracks
        with a CodecID of A_MS/ACM.

2003-05-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Released v0.3.1.

        * Tracks read from a Matroska file will keep their UID if it
        hasn't been used yet.

        * Support for reading text subtitle streams from OGM files.

        * Added support for EbmlVoid everywhere to mkvinfo.

2003-05-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

        * Support for KaxTrackLanguage and ISO639 languages.
