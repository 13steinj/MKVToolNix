Things I have to do before I even CONSIDER a proper release:

* mkvmerge (muxer):

- splitting after a specific size


* mkvdemux:

- write it ;)
- support for video (to AVI), AC3, MP3, PCM (to WAV), Vorbis (to Ogg)
- man page


* general:

- debian subdir ;)
- The final version of the Matroska specs should be available.
